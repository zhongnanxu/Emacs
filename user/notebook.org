** Assessment of the stability and activity of single atom catalysis
There have not been too many computational studies on this point. One of the few ones I could find was one that studied Fe adsorption on phosphine cite:kulish-2015-adsor, but there aren't that many results and the analysis isn't too strong. I wonder if many computationalists are not as interested in this. I guess supported nanoclusters have been studied in a while. Also the excitement for this single atom catalysis could be dwindling.

** Thermodynamic models for predicting surface segregation of mixed oxides
*** DONE Should probably read this article cite:richter-2013-concen-vacan.
** Project with organic perovskites for solar cell applications -- possibly an interface study
** Trends in reactivity of other inorganic compounds (nitrides, carbides, phosphides, sulfides)

A recent experimental paper from Jaramillo cite:kibsgaard-2014-molyb-phosp showed a mixed Sulfide/Phosphide was active for hydrogen evolution.

It seems like a majority of these deviations are done on very high surface-energy facts with many broken bonds. Higher quality work would take into account these considerations cite:michalsky-2014-depar-adsor.

** Understanding coverage effects on transition metal compounds

Results from Michalsky cite:michalsky-2014-depar-adsor also show a coverage effect for transition metal carbides with coadsorbed oxygen atoms. These are more apparent on reduced surfaces. I wonder if coverage is meaningful to investigate. I should look at a previous study of coverage

From their results of Scheffler cite:reuter-2003-compos-co,reuter-2004-stead-state, the only lower coverages they performed were at 0.125 and 0.25 ML coverage of rutile sites. With these calculations, they found less than a 0.15 eV difference in adsorption energies of O or CO. 

However, Rossmeisl has found up to a 1-2 eV effect of coverage on O and OH on both RuO2 and IrO2 cite:rossmeisl-2007-elect. Another paper found 3 eV level changes of the adsorption energy of Fe with coverage cite:pabisiak-2014-fe-fe2o3.

Similarly for perovskite surfaces, coverage plays an important role as well, wich up to 1.5 eV shifts in the adsorption energy cite:montoya-2015-theor.
