                  two-dimensional direct-bandgap nanomaterial. Based
                  on first-principles calculations{,} we present a
                  systematic study on the binding energy{,}
                  geometry{,} magnetic moment and electronic structure
                  of 20 different adatoms adsorbed on phosphorene. The
                  adatoms cover a wide range of valences{,} including
                  s and p valence metals{,} 3d transition metals{,}
                  noble metals{,} semiconductors{,} hydrogen and
                  oxygen. We find that adsorbed adatoms produce a rich
                  diversity of structural{,} electronic and magnetic
                  properties. Our work demonstrates that phosphorene
                  forms strong bonds with all studied adatoms while
                  still preserving its structural integrity. The
                  adsorption energies of adatoms on phosphorene are
                  more than twice higher than on graphene{,} while the
                  largest distortions of phosphorene are only
                  [similar]0.1-0.2 A. The charge carrier type in
                  phosphorene can be widely tuned by adatom
                  adsorption. The unique combination of high
                  reactivity with good structural stability is very
                  promising for potential applications of
                  phosphorene.",

                  Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the
